    <p>These sauerkraut cabbage rolls, which successfully combine sweet,
        spicy, savory, and sour flavors, are like a family hug, real comfort food in the Balkans way</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs sour cabbage leaves (or one large head)</li>
        <li>10 ounces ground veal (beef or lamb may be used if you prefer)</li>
        <li>1‚ÅÑ3 cup rice</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely minced</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>paprika</li>
        <li>beef stock or water</li>
        <li>butter and sour cream, to serve</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Separate the cabbage leaves, being careful not to tear them.</li>
        <li>Mix meat, rice, onion, salt, pepper, and paprika.</li>
        <li>Place about a tablespoon or more (use your own judgment based on the size of the leaves) of the meat mixture into each cabbage leaf, near its base.</li>
        <li>Begin rolling the leaf from the base into a thick cylinder, tucking in the sides after the first "roll."</li>
        <li>Layer the cylinders tightly into a medium-sized or large pot.</li>
        <li>Cover the sarma with beef stock or water (I find that if you use water, it makes its own broth anyways with the mwad as it cooks)</li>
        <li>Cover the pot, bring to boil, and simmer for at least three hours.</li>
        <li>Serve with butter and sour cream, with ro without some of the  cooking liquids according to your preference.</li>
    </ol>
